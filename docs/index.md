::: info Project Goals & Scope
After earning a specialization in **Investment Management with Python and Machine Learning** from EDHEC Business School ([**`Credential ID: WUTZABL42PW8`**](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/WUTZABL42PW8)), I compiled key financial and mathematical concepts into a Python module. This project is documented in Jupyter notebooks and here on Vitepress.

The main goal of this project is to provide an accessible, structured, and practical approach to modern investment strategies and portfolio management techniques. It aims to bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world application, enabling users—from students to professional investors—to implement and test various investment strategies using Python.

The content spans several core areas:

- **Fundamental Analysis**: Introducing basic concepts such as returns calculations and risk assessments.
- **Quantitative Methods**: Covering advanced statistical and mathematical techniques to optimize portfolios and manage risks effectively.
- **Machine Learning Applications**: Demonstrating how machine learning can be applied to enhance predictive accuracy in investment decisions.
- **Interactive Learning**: Each module includes interactive Jupyter notebooks that allow users to experiment with real data, tweak parameters, and observe the outcomes in real-time.

This educational toolkit is not just a passive learning resource but an active framework for engaging with and mastering the complexities of financial markets through technology.
